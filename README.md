## Cyber Analytics Dashboard (Static UI)

This repository contains a **static HTML/CSS dashboard** that visualizes key metrics from a
cybersecurity incidents dataset.  

It is a **UI-only slice** of my larger project  
👉 [AI-Powered-Cyber-Analytics](https://github.com/GouthamiN25/AI-Powered-Cyber-Analytics),  
where the full machine learning, RAG, and backend logic live.

## 🎯 What this repo is

- A simple **frontend prototype** for a Cyber Analytics dashboard  
- Built with **plain HTML + CSS** (no backend, no JS framework)  
- Designed as a **landing page / executive view** that could sit in front of a larger cyber platform  

Typical information shown on the dashboard:

- Overall incident volume  
- Severity patterns  
- Department / asset-level breakdowns  
- High-level SOC-style insights

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** for structure  
- **CSS3** for layout, typography, and styling  
- CSV (`merged_cyber_incidents.csv`) used while designing the visuals
